       <div>Please read this document carefully as it contains important information about your central heating installation agreement.</div>
       <div><br></div>
       <div>If you have any questions, please let us know prior to proceeding with the quote.</div>
       <div><br></div>
       <div>1. i) We will carry out the work detailed in the heating quotation, for the price that is stated in it, subject to the following terms and conditions.All prices include VAT at the current rate.</div>
       <div>ii) The work will be carried out as quickly as possible, in accordance with the specification overleaf. This specification may be amended upon receipt of the customer’s agreement in writing.</div>
       <div>2.The quote is valid for 28 days and we must begin the work within 90 days of you accepting your quote. After this time your quote will be invalid and you will require a new quote should you wish to have work carried out by us.</div>
       <div>3. i) We will provide a 1 year guarantee on the workmanship of the central heating parts we install.</div>
       <div>ii) The guarantee will include the free replacement of materials and mechanical components. It shall not include or be liable for any loss, damage or expense as a result of a fault or defect in the aforementioned materials and/or mechanical components.</div>
       <div>iii) Where a manufacturer warranty exists for faulty or defect materials and/or mechanical components, we will put you in touch with the relevant manufacturer in order to rectify the fault or defect.</div>
       <div>4.The price we quote does not include the cost of removing any dangerous or difficult to remove waste materials,such as asbestos, that we could not reasonably identify when we gave you your quote.You can call a specialist contractor to remove these materials or we may be able to arrange for them to be removed at an extra cost.When asbestos is removed you will need to produce a ‘site clearance for reoccupation’ certificate, which you can get from the asbestos removal company, before we can continue to work at your property.</div>
       <div>5. The price we quote includes removing all non-dangerous materials where practically possible, including your old boiler and central heating parts we replace.</div>
       <div>6. Any time frames we give you are our best estimates and we will do what we can to keep to those time frames.Where there are likely to be delays we will let you know as soon as possible and inform you of a new time frame estimation.The time it takes us to complete the work has no effect on the price we quoted you.</div>
       <div>7. We may need you to lift carpets or take up all or some other floor coverings, including tongue-and-grooved floor coverings, parquet, hardwood,rubber or tiled floors,so we can complete the work.We will give you as much notice as possible if we need you to do this.You can call a specialist contractor to do this work or we may be able to do it for you at an extra cost. If we do any of this work for you, we will only be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused directly by our negligence and it will be your responsibility to put the flooring back once the work is completed.</div>
       <div>8. We will take care to carry out the work without causing damage to your property. If we cause unnecessary damage because of negligence we will put it right. Sometimes we have to do extra work if we cannot use existing pipework or wiring to install the boiler, and this can cause damage to things like inside and outside finishings (for example, wall coverings and paint).You may need to redecorate,repair or restore certain areas once the work is completed.This is not included in the price we quoted and you will be responsible for this.</div>
       <div>9. If you are a tenant, you will need your landlord’s permission before you allow us to start the work, and we may need you to give us evidence that you have got this permission. If we carry out work at the landlord’s property and you have not got permission or have given us false or inaccurate information, you will compensate us for any losses we suffer because of your failure to get your landlord’s permission.</div>
       <div>10. If your property is a listed building, it is your responsibility to make sure that you get any permission you need before we start the work, and we will need evidence from you that you have got this permission. If you do not get the permission you need, you may be prosecuted in the criminal courts.We will not be able to start any work if you have not got the appropriate planning permission or if you are unable to give us evidence that you have this permission. If we carry out work at your property and you have given us false or inaccurate information, you will compensate us for any losses we suffer because of your failure to get the permission you needed, which may include court fines and penalties.</div>
       <div>11. You will need to have an adequate gas and electricity supply to your property before we can start the work.</div>
       <div>12. Where we have connected new equipment to your existing system, we cannot accept responsibility for the cost of repairing or replacing parts of your existing system that later develop faults, unless we have been negligent in not realising that this damage to your existing system would happen or unless the way we carried out the work was negligent and this caused the fault.</div>
       <div>13. We will test your water supply pressure before we start work.As water supply rates can change, we cannot be responsible for your central heating system failing to work properly because your water supply becomes inadequate or keeps changing, unless we were negligent in how we tested your water pressure.</div>
       <div>14. i) Where flues pass through outside walls, we will make good where necessary with ordinary Portland cement and sand, and no attempt will be made to colour match any existing finish. ii) Where flues pass through voids or are boxed in it is the customer’s responsibility to have inspection hatches fitted. We will inform you of this as soon as practically possible. iii)Where existing flue openings are bricked up by us, ordinary red building bricks shall be used unless alternative bricks are provided by the customer at the time of the installation.</div>
       <div>15. If you need a deeper clean to remove sludge and other waste from your central heating system, we will recommend you buy a Powerflush with your installation. Our engineer will also tell you what other work is needed to avoid future problems.We may suggest you correct any design faults that may cause the problem to return.</div>
       <div>16. We cannot be responsible if we cannot meet our responsibilities because of things beyond our control including, for example, poor weather conditions, industrial disputes,strikes that we are not directly involved in or if we find that species (for example bats, birds, butterflies and dormice) or plants that could be subject to special protection are found to be present in your property.</div>
       <div>17. To carry out the work as quickly as possible, we may use one of our approved installers. All installers that we use are fully qualified and Gas Safe registered, and they all carry identity cards. We are responsible for the approved installers we use.</div>
       <div>18. i) Your credit or debit card will be authorised for the amount we quote to carry out the work at the time of checking out on our website. The same card will be used to release payment to us once the installation is complete. You authorise us to use this card to process a payment for the remaining balance of the quoted price once the work has been completed.</div>
       <div>19. Any bank or interest charges incurred by us as a result of a default in payment will be passed on you.</div>
       <div>20. The risk in the goods will be passed to you upon delivery, but the goods will remain our property until the quoted price is paid in full.</div>
       <div>21. We will register the manufacturer warranty which comes with your boiler if we installed one and the installation will be completed according to current gas safety regulations.</div>
